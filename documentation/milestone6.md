# Milestone 6 - Batch Processing: Databricks

## Databricks account
A Databricks account has been provided by Ai Core. 

## Mount S3 bucket to Databricks
To clean and query the batch data, the data needs to be read from the S3 bucket into Databricks. To do this, the S3 Bucket needs to be mounted to the Databricks account. Ai Core has provided full access to S3 and an `Access Key` and `Secret Access Key`. Credentials have been uploaded to Databricks. 

The notebook mount_s3bucket_to_databricks in the Databricks_notebook directory contains the code used in Databricks.
